          Hi, {"I'm"}Sjors ðŸ‘‹
          <br />
          <br />
          {"I've"} been working on Subtitle Tools in my spare time for the past
          6 years. People from all over the world visit this website to fix
          their subtitles.
          <br />
          <br />I want to keep this website free to use for everyone. Please
          consider upgrading to premium if you want to help keep the lights on.
          Thank you!
        </p>
